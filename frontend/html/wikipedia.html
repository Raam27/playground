      <p>
        <b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated <b>JS</b>, is
        a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
        Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use
        JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often
        incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
        networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web
        browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are
        now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The
        most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective
        standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
        design.

        The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was
        released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
        prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15]
        The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
        which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
        This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]
      </p>
      <p>
        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,
        lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in
        the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene
        to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a
        scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
        this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming
        language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme
        language.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
        Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to
        devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme
        or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and
        its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped
        as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to
        JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it
        is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and
        Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
        marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]

        Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war
        with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the
        Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[20]
      </p>
      <p>
        JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS
        and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably
        different from their counterparts in Navigator.[21][22] These
        differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work
        well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of "best viewed in
        Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several
        years.[21][23]

      <p>
        In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International,
        as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser
        vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first
        ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of
        ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on
        ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20]
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the
        browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share
        reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard
        for client-side scripting on the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and
        implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it
        stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.
      </p>

        </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s,
        client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when
        the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser.
        Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from
        Internet Explorer.[25]
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the
        ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly
        with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing
        E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4
        draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new
        ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin
        implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and
        ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side
        scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never
        reached fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source
        communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett
        released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a
        set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web
        applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the
        need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of
        JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities
        that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including
        jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine
        that was faster than its competition.[26][27] The key innovation was
        just-in-time compilation (JIT),[28] so other browser vendors needed to
        overhaul their engines for JIT.[29]
      </p>
      <p>
        In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in
        Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all
        relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the
        ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.
      </p>

          <span>]</span>
        </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating
        in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized
        with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[30]
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant
        increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node
        combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a
        stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[31][32] As of 2018, Node had been
        used by millions of developers,[33] and npm had the most modules of any
        package manager in the world.[34]
      </p>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on
        GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[35]
        Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive
        proposal process.[36][37] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers
        check the status of upcoming features individually.[35]
      </p>
      <p>
        The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks,
        established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript
        outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications
        and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been
        created to aid the development process.[38]

        JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web,
        with 97% of websites using it for this purpose.[12] Scripts are embedded
        in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major
        web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on
        the user's device.

        Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web
        framework for their client-side scripting.[13]
      </p>
      <p>
        jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of
        websites.[13] Facebook created the React library for its website and
        later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now
        use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its
        websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project
        used by others.[13]
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not
        using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard
        JavaScript functionality.[41]
